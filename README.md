======

Govsee is an online platform for visualizing government structure.  Our mission is to help make government more transparent by making it easier for people to understand the complexities of their governments.  We must understand government before we can evaluate or improve it.

Core functionality:
1) Visualization of Structure - A searchable, interactive pan and zoom interface will allow users to navigate gov structure just as they do in Google Earth.

2) Wiki-based content - registered users can add/remove or modify nodes, and update information stored for orgs, positions, and people.

3) Index of Resources - We can associate twitter feeds, open data sets, tumblr blogs, facebook pages and other "feeds" of related information to a particular org, position, or person.  We can link content such as news articles and "tag" organizations, positions, or people.

4) Discussions and Rating - Yelp for Government.  We believe the Yelp for Government concept works best when coupled with an intuitive navigation system.  We can have star ratings for orgs, positions, and people.  We can have reddit-style upvoting and downvoting of linked content and self-directed discussion topics.
